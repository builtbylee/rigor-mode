# Skill: testing

## Goal
Make changes safe by default.

## Minimum expectations
- For behavior changes: add or update tests, or provide an explicit verification procedure.
- For bugfixes: add a regression test when feasible.

## Output
- What was tested
- How it was tested
- What remains unverified (if anything)
