# Rigor Pack: What you get

This pack is organized to be usable across all projects:

- Global: `USER_RULES.md` (paste into Antigravity User Rules)
- Reusable assets: `.agent/skills` and `.agent/workflows`
- Optional role cards: `.agent/agents`

If Antigravity only loads `.agent/workflows` and `.agent/skills` from a project root, use symlinks so every project points to this pack.
